## Formatting

### editorconfig

**Maintain the coding style** used throughout the project.

This project includes a [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig) file. Make sure your editor
is considering it for automatic formatting of the source code. If your editor does
not support `.editorconfig` files, open the file and apply those settings manually.
